# Clojure
### A Lisp dialect for the JVM
- Dynamic
- Hosted / Leverages Java ecosystem
- Built-in collection of __immutable__, __persistent__ data structures
- Concurrency done right / STM Agents CSP TLS
- Metaprogramming / Macros
- Functional but pragmatic

---

# ClojureScript
### Clojure compiled to JavaScript
- Run on JS clients / Browser Desktop Mobile Server
- Interop with JS libraries
- Leverage the Googleplex via Closure compiler
- Dynamic host language enables additional features

---

# ClojureScript Toolchain

- cljs cannot compile itself, the Clojure compiler consumes cljs and emits JavaScript.
- Leiningen is your friend.  Use the lein-cljsbuild plugin.
- The emitted js is either used directly or fed to Closure, Google's optimizing js compiler, depending on the optimization settings.
- Closure's advanced optimization mode can yield dramatic improvements.

#Macros provide extensible semantics

Enables 'language features' as libraries

- _Logic programming_: `core.logic`

- _Optional type system with inference_: `core.typed`

- _Pattern matching_: `core.match`

- _CSP_: `core.async`

#Why?
###Epochal Model of Time

- Time is discrete
- Clients observe snapshots of state over time
- Snapshots of state are values. Values are immutable.
- The next time quantum is calculated as a function of the previous.
- procedural / OO time is implicit

---

#Isn't that inefficient?

- Naive implementation would just copy
- __Immutability enables structural sharing__
- Sophisticated data structure implementatation necessary for practical usage.
- Not sufficient to just avoid mutation in a procedural / OO language.

---

#funken

- Reactive programming with an epochal time model
- signals update over time, but only observed in discrete steps
- progression of time is explicit
- observers only notified when signal value actually changes
